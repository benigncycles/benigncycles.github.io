- We said *circles* the first 2 episodes, just imagine we got our own name right
- [How to make everything](https://www.youtube.com/c/MakeEverythingTv), [Garum epsiode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StoZrjiCLvs), *condiment* was the word we were missing
- [Risk concealment](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-24301-6)
- [Dictators handbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook)/[Economics of political survival](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/logic-political-survival)
- We probably got the DAG discussion wrong, sorry
- [Swiss Democracy Book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-63266-3)
- We surely made additional mistakes, let us know in the comments!
